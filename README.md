# 🏥 Healthcare Predictive Analytics – Disease Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes risk using machine learning models and healthcare data. 
The goal is to support early disease detection through data-driven insights and visualization.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Public & anonymized)
- Features: Age, BMI, Blood Glucose, HbA1c, Hypertension, Heart Disease, Smoking History
- Target: Diabetes (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Removed duplicate records
- Corrected data types
- Encoded categorical variables
- Normalized numerical features

## 🤖 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest (Final Model)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall (focus on diabetic class)
- F1-score

## 📊 Visualization
- Tableau dashboards for exploratory analysis
- Age, BMI, and Blood Glucose vs Diabetes charts

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
- Used only public and anonymized data
- No personal identifiable information included
- Model is for decision support, not diagnosis

## 🏁 Conclusion
Random Forest provided the best balance between accuracy and recall, making it suitable for healthcare risk prediction.
